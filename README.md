# Easock
Simple Socket Library in C

## Installation
Just include **Easock.h** in your program.

## In progress
This is my little project to understand more C programming language, so don't judge me.
I'll doing my best to improve my C skill, it's so fun and i'll need to use it in my job someday.

Thanks!
